# 🧠 MEM_SCAN

MEM_SCAN is a premium **Neo-Brutalist memory matching game** built with **React + Vite**.
The interface is designed like a **system console** — sharp borders, strong hierarchy, and tactile feedback instead of playful visuals.



---

## ✨ Features

* Neo-Brutalist UI with hard edges and high contrast
* Smooth 3D card-flip animations
* Glitch / shake feedback on incorrect matches
* Fully responsive (desktop → mobile)
* Touch-friendly grid layout
* Clean and readable React state logic
* Fast development and builds using Vite

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* React — UI and state management
* Vite — development server and production build
* Vanilla CSS — handcrafted Neo-Brutalist styling

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

MEM_SCAN treats the UI like a **system interface**, not a casual game.

* Borders define structure
* Motion communicates feedback
* Typography conveys authority
* Errors are felt, not ignored

Every interaction is intentional and deliberate.

* Sound and haptic feedback
* Timed and difficulty modes
* Performance ranking system
